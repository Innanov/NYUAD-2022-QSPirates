## Developing a quantum sensor simulator for virus detection.
Quantum Sensors are used to increase Covid-19 detection accuracy and test results, and decrease the cost of testing. Our project aims to extend the benefit of these results to a variety of viruses. Having a quantum sensor simulator instead of the full quantum sensor hardware to detect the presence of viruses can save researchers time, the expense of materials, and effort. For the global community, the increased accessibility for researchers to understand life-threatening and harmful viruses can potentially mean increased quality of community health.
