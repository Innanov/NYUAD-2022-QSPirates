## Quantum Sensor:

Sensor measures more accurately. Zero level to one level electricity quBit shows changing levels. 
Measurements classical data 
take the data and store in quantum memory and process it with quantum computing. 

## Task list:

Looking into quantum sensing simulation: Nouhalia

What kind of state of change the sensor is occuring with the detection of Covid-19?: Sakib
